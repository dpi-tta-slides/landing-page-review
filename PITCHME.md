# Landing Page Review

---

## Why Landing Pages Matter

- Often the first user interaction with your product
- Convert visitors into users, customers, or stakeholders
- Communicate the **value** of using your product
- A weak landing page can sink a strong app

---

## 5 Second Test

Can your visitors tell what your landing page is about in 5 seconds or less?

Within 5 seconds users should be able to answer:

- What's the landing page about?
- What's the call-to-action/offer of the landing page?
- Who's the company behind the landing page?
- Do you find the landing page trustworthy?
- Any other questions you're curious about

<!-- 

research found that users can assess the visual appeal of a web page in as little as 50 milliseconds (0.05 s). This means that parts of the first impression are formed in less time than a blink of an eye.

## Landing Page

- Design and Professionalism

<!--

Does the landing page present a professional and appealing design, utilizing a consistent color scheme, typography, and high-quality images/graphics to create a positive first impression?

Accessibility

Clear language

Readability

-->

- Clear Value Proposition

<!--

Is the value proposition prominently displayed, clearly explaining what problem it solves, and why it's beneficial?

-->

- Clear Audience Targeting

<!-- Is the target audience clearly communicated? -->

- Call to Action

<!--

Does the page feature a clear and compelling call to action (CTA), such as a sign-up or get-started button, that is easily identifiable and encourages visitors to engage with the app?

-->

- Explanation of Features (What the app does) and Benefits (Why users should care)

<!--

Is there a concise explanation of how the app works, through a combination of text, visuals (e.g. infographics), to illustrate the app's key features and benefits?

-->

- Demo Video

<!--

Does the landing page include a demo video (or gif) that allows visitors to experience the app's functionality firsthand without needing to sign up?

-->

- Social Proof

<!--

Are there elements of social proof, such as testimonials, user reviews, case studies or media mentions, that build trust and credibility with the audience?

-->
